# Quantitative-Analysis-of-Stock-Market-Trends-Project
Engineering 102 (Spring 2020) Project 1

# Introduction
The stock market data analysis was conducted in order to identify some of the best and worst stocks from a list of 22 companies. This work was necessary as it provided essential information for potential investors to make wise financial decisions regarding their investments in the stock market. This project primarily benefited investors looking to make a return on their investment.

# 1.1 Problem Statement
The problem faced in this project was to identify the best and worst investments that could be made among several companies using previous stock market data. The challenge faced was to produce a MATLAB script file that would compute statistical markers such as the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and standard deviation, and then plot graphs for the stock prices for a list of companies. Overarching issues included understanding what made an ideal stock, along with recommending the best industry to invest in.

There were several major objectives that were accomplished by conducting this research. The first objective was to conduct sufficient background research to better understand the stock market and various stock related softwares. The next objective was to develop an efficient MATLAB script file that would compute a range of statistical markers for stock prices over a 4-year period. The third objective was to analyze the values in the tables and plots to identify the most stable and riskiest stocks to invest in. Lastly, the best industry to invest in also had to be determined.
